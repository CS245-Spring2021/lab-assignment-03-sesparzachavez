The runtime is O(n^2). Each loop has a runtime of O(n) and so together their runtime is squared. 

If I can figure out a way to make the second part of the sorting a part of the loops that sort the array in ascening order, then my runtime would remain the same. If I can not, my runtime would be longer. 

This is not my best coding. It's a solution I worked on during class and in all honesty had forgotten about this assigment until I got off of work today. 

I would greatly appreciate your feedback on this and whether or not it would be possible to execute my orginal plan.
